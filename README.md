# Water Pollution Dashboad
 
## 🌊 Introduction

This water pollution dashboard was created to help explore the environmental and public health conditions across 10 countries, using key water quality indicators. It allows users to interactively analyze pollution levels and understand their correlation with access to clean water, disease rates, and socio-economic factors.

The data was used as part of my Excel learning journey, where I practiced building interactive dashboards using advanced Excel tools and techniques.

##📊 Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in Water_Pollution_Dashboard.xlsx.

##🧠 Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- 📉 Charts & Visualizations (column, bar, map-based visuals, KPI boxes)

- 🔁 Data Validation (dropdown filters for country, year, pollution indicator)

- 🧮 Formulas and Functions (XLOOKUP, FILTER, INDEX, MATCH, MEDIAN, SEQUENCE)

- ⚙️ Dynamic Named Ranges and Spill Functions

- 📌 Conditional Formatting & KPI Design

##💧 Water Pollution Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains water pollution and health-related data across 10 countries, measured over multiple years. It includes detailed information on:

- 🏞️ Water source types (lake, well, river, etc.)

- 🧪 Contaminant levels (lead, nitrates, turbidity, bacteria count, etc.)

- 💧 Water quality metrics (pH level, dissolved oxygen, etc.)

- 🏥 Disease cases (cholera, typhoid, diarrhea)

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Access to clean water

- 📉 GDP per capita, sanitation, healthcare access
