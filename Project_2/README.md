### All Nobel Prize winners from 1901-2025 Dataset (2025-03-25)

This dataset compiles historical records of Nobel Prize awards. It contains data on the award year, prize category, and prize amounts (both original and inflation-adjusted). The dataset includes detailed information on laureates such as their names, birth and death details, and professional affiliations. For organizational award recipients, it also provides founding information and native names. This resource supports analyses of trends in Nobel Prize history and profiles of both individual and institutional awardees.


### 🔍 Skill: Power Query (ETL)

#### 📥 Extract

- I first used Power Query to extract the original data (`nobel.csv`) and create two queries:
    - 🗃️ First one with all the nobel prize laureates information.
    - 🔧 The second listing the affiliated institutions for each nobel ID.

#### 🔄 Transform

- Then, I transformed each query by changing column types, removing unnecessary columns, cleaning incomplete birth dates, extracting founding years for organizations, filling missing values with "Organization", and removing rows with errors or null IDs.
    - 📊 nobel

        ![1](/images/1.png)

    - 🛠️ nobel_affiliation

        ![2](/images/2.png)

#### 🔗 Load

- Finally, I loaded both transformed queries into the workbook, setting the foundation for my subsequent analysis.
    - 📊 nobel

        ![3](/images/3.png)

    - 🛠️ nobel_affiliation

        ![4](/images/4.png)


### 🧮 Skills: PivotTables & DAX

#### 📈Pivot Table

- 🔢 I created a PivotTables using the Data Model I created with Power Pivot.

- 🏛️ To analyze institutional affiliations from a related query (`nobel_affiliation`), I used DAX measures with `CROSSFILTER` to enable filtering across related tables.

```
Median Prize Adjusted Aff. :=
CALCULATE(
    [Median Prize Adjusted],
    CROSSFILTER(nobel[nobel_id], nobel_affiliation[nobel_id], BOTH)
)
```
- 👥 To prevent visual errors in charts when no affiliations were found, I wrapped the measure with IF to return 0 instead of blank:

```
Names Affiliated :=
IF(
    ISBLANK(CALCULATE([Names], CROSSFILTER(nobel[nobel_id], nobel_affiliation[nobel_id], BOTH))),
    0,
    CALCULATE([Names], CROSSFILTER(nobel[nobel_id], nobel_affiliation[nobel_id], BOTH))
)
```

#### 🧮 DAX

- 📊 I added new measures to calculate the median prize and median prize adjusted awarded to laureates.

```
  Median Prize := MEDIAN(nobel[prizeAmount])
```

- 🧮 I formatted the `dateAwarded` column to remove timestamps

```
  = FORMAT(nobel[dateAwarded], "yyyy-mm-dd")
```
- 📅 then used the `awardYear` column to fill in missing dates, ensuring every laureate had a complete award date.

```
    =IF(
	ISBLANK([dateAwarded]),
	DATE([awardYear], 1, 1),
	[dateAwarded]
    )
```

### 🔧 Skill: Power Pivot

#### 💪 Power Pivot

- 🔗 I created a data model by integrating the `nobel` and `nobel_affiliation` tables into one model.
- 🧹 Since I had already cleaned the data using Power Query; Power Pivot created a relationship between these two tables.

#### 🔗 Data Model

- I created a relationship between my two tables using the `nobel_id` column.
